# tinder
educational purpose only

!hardcoded for 1366x768 resolution screens!

there are 2 main different file types
the ones for tinder and the ones for bumble
maybe gonna seperate them, but for now theyre all uploaded here

also 2 main different types: parallel and normal (without parallel)
parallel means, that its optimized for 2 windows (split in the half of the screen) - one half uses tinder and the other one uses bumble

boost elo is the most advanced version and also uses dislikes in order to not go too low with the elo-score in order to be seen by other people

everything else is pretty self-explatonary
